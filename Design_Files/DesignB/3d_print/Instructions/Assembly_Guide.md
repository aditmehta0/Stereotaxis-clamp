| Item                              | Details                                               |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clamp Body (Printed)**          | From provided STL file — 6.1 mm rod holes              |
| **M4 Brass Inserts (×2)**         | Heat-set type (Amazon B07YSV66Y5, Ø outer ~5.3 mm)     |
| **M4 Knurled Thumb Screws (×2)**  | NACX, M4 × 12 mm thread (Amazon B0BMG5JKY2)            |
| **Optional: Nylon Washers (×2)**  | Ø4.3 mm ID, prevents damage to plastic during clamping |
| **Soldering Iron**                | With flat or conical tip for brass insert setting      |
| **6 mm Metal Rods**               | Surgical vertical rods (100 mm long)                   |
| **Bench Vise or Rod Holder**      | For installation into stereotaxic frame (optional)     |

## 🖨️ 1. Print the Clamp

- **Printer Type**: SLA recommended (e.g., Formlabs, Anycubic Photon)
- **Material**: Tough or Durable Resin (Formlabs Tough 2000 recommended)
- **Orientation**: Print flat side down to minimize support on rod holes
- **Post-processing**:
  - Rinse in IPA
  - Fully cure under UV
  - Sand rod holes only if insertion is tight (>6.1 mm nominal diameter)

---

## 🔩 2. Install Brass Inserts

1. Preheat your soldering iron to ~190–210 °C
2. Align the insert vertically into the screw hole on the clamp
3. Gently press down with the iron until flush — do not over-insert
4. Let it cool undisturbed (~10 seconds)
5. Repeat for the second hole

✅ Make sure insert holes are opposite the rod holes (i.e., for horizontal screws)

## 🧷 3. Rod Insertion & Clamping

1. Insert the first 6 mm rod fully into either hole
   - This is the reference rod — usually the one mounted on your stereotaxic frame
2. Insert the second 6 mm rod into the opposite hole, aligning it 1 inch (25.4 mm) apart
   - This rod hovers over the mouse skull

🔧 Use knurled thumb screws to gently clamp each rod:
- Add nylon washers under screw heads (optional)
- Tighten just enough to prevent rotation/slip
- Do not overtighten to avoid thread damage

## 🧠 4. Deployment & Usage

- Attach the clamp to your stereotaxic rig via the reference rod
- Adjust the floating rod's position precisely above the skull
- Use the offset rod to hold:
  - Micromanipulators
  - Microinjectors
  - Implants or tool arms

✅ The design ensures fixed 1” center-to-center spacing, rotational alignment, and height control.

## 🧽 Maintenance Tips

- Avoid soaking clamp in solvents (e.g., acetone) — clean with IPA or mild soap
- For repeated use:
  - Use stainless steel thumbscrews
  - Check insert retention after ~20 uses
